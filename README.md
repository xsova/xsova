# Hi, I'm Bryce (xsova)

I'm a Computer Science student at [SNHU](https://snhu.edu), with a concentration in Software Development. Originally from Morro Bay, CA, and currently based in Omaha, NE.

I enjoy:
- Making changes to my config files
- Customizing keyboard hardware, firmware, and layouts
- Trying to learn all the things
